# Decision-Tree-Classifier

1. Introduction to Decision Tree Algorithm
The Decision Tree algorithm is a popular supervised machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. It creates a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on several input variables. The model is represented as a tree structure, where each internal node corresponds to a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents a final output label.

2. Classification and Regression Trees
Decision Trees can be classified into two categories:

Classification Trees: Used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., car safety: safe or unsafe).
Regression Trees: Used when the target variable is continuous (e.g., predicting the price of a car).
In this project, we will focus on building a classification tree to predict the safety of cars.

3. Decision Tree Algorithm Terminology
Node: Represents a feature or attribute.
Branch: Represents a decision rule.
Leaf: Represents a class label or final outcome.
Root Node: The topmost node that represents the entire dataset.
4. Decision Tree Algorithm Intuition
The goal of a Decision Tree is to create a model that predicts the target variable by partitioning the data into subsets based on feature values. The tree structure allows for easy interpretation of the decision-making process.

5. Attribute Selection Measures
To construct the tree, we need to decide which attribute to split on at each node. Two commonly used measures are:

5.1 Information Gain
Information Gain is based on the concept of entropy, which measures the uncertainty in a dataset. The attribute with the highest Information Gain is chosen for splitting.

5.2 Gini Index
The Gini Index measures impurity in a dataset. A lower Gini Index indicates a purer node. The attribute with the lowest Gini Index is preferred for splitting.

6. Overfitting in Decision Tree Algorithm
Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex, capturing noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern. This can be mitigated by pruning the tree, setting a maximum depth, or using fewer attributes.

7. Import Libraries
To implement the Decision Tree Classifier, start by importing the necessary libraries.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
8. Import Dataset
Load the car safety dataset. For this example, we will assume it is a CSV file.

python
Copy code
data = pd.read_csv('car_safety_data.csv')
9. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct an exploratory analysis to understand the data better. This includes checking for missing values, visualizing distributions, and understanding relationships between features.

python
Copy code
# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Visualize data
sns.pairplot(data, hue='safety')
plt.show()
10. Declare Feature Vector and Target Variable
Define the feature vector (input variables) and the target variable (output label).

python
Copy code
X = data.drop('safety', axis=1)  # All columns except 'safety'
y = data['safety']                # Target variable
11. Split Data into Separate Training and Test Set
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

python
Copy code
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
12. Feature Engineering
Consider any necessary feature engineering, such as scaling, encoding categorical variables, or creating new features.

python
Copy code
# Example of encoding categorical variables if necessary
X = pd.get_dummies(X, drop_first=True)
13. Decision Tree Classifier with Criterion Gini Index
Build the Decision Tree Classifier using the Gini index as the splitting criterion.

python
Copy code
gini_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='gini', random_state=42)
gini_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred_gini = gini_tree.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
print('Accuracy (Gini Index):', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_gini))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_gini))
14. Decision Tree Classifier with Criterion Entropy
Now, build another Decision Tree Classifier using entropy as the criterion.

python
Copy code
entropy_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=42)
entropy_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred_entropy = entropy_tree.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
print('Accuracy (Entropy):', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_entropy))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_entropy))
15. Conclusion
In this project, we implemented a Decision Tree Classifier to predict car safety. We compared two models, one using the Gini index and another using entropy as the criteria for splitting. By evaluating the modelsâ€™ performance, we gained insights into the effectiveness of each approach.

Future steps could include further tuning of hyperparameters, addressing potential overfitting through techniques like pruning, and exploring other algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.

This detailed process provides a solid framework for building and evaluating Decision Tree Classifiers for car safety prediction.
